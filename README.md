Frontend Description
Your frontend is a simple, elegant UI built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to communicate with the backend REST API and display recommended products. This approach avoids heavy frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to understand.

Technologies & Structure
HTML: Provides the structure and semantic layout of the webpage.

Contains a heading (<h1>) titled "Recommended Products."

Has an unordered list (<ul>) with an ID attribute, where JavaScript will dynamically insert recommended items received from the backend.

CSS: Controls the presentation and aesthetics for a modern look.

Applies a vibrant gradient background across the entire page for visual appeal.

Centers the content in a clean white container with rounded borders and drop shadows to mimic a “card” look.

Styles each product as a colorful card with smooth hover animations (lifting and shadow).

Uses responsive design techniques so the UI adapts gracefully on different screen sizes.

JavaScript: Responsible for dynamic content loading and interactivity.

Uses the modern Fetch API to request recommendations JSON data from the Spring Boot backend API endpoint.

Parses the JSON response and programmatically creates and appends list items (<li>) for each product.

Implements error handling to gracefully manage failed or unreachable API calls.

Workflow
When a user visits the webpage, the JavaScript automatically triggers a backend call to fetch recommended products for a given user ID. Upon receiving the recommendations, the UI is updated in real-time without reloading the page, showing a list of styled recommendation cards with smooth animations.

Why Plain HTML/CSS/JS?
Simplicity: No extra tooling or frameworks make it easier for beginners or quick prototypes.

Low Overhead: Quick page loads and minimal complexity.

Flexibility: Easy to modify or upgrade parts using standard web technologies.

Seamless Backend Integration: Clean JSON communication with your Spring Boot REST API.

Backend Description
Your backend is powered by Spring Boot and Lombok to build a robust, modular REST API that supplies recommendation data to your frontend.

Technologies & Components
Spring Boot: A framework that drastically simplifies Java backend development with embedded servers, auto-configuration, and easy REST endpoint creation.

Lombok: A Java library that removes boilerplate code by auto-generating commonly needed methods like constructors, getters, setters, and toString via annotations.

REST Controller: Exposes HTTP endpoints that your frontend consumes. Handles user requests, invoking service methods, and returns JSON responses.

Service Layer: Implements recommendation logic, currently serving static demo data but designed for future AI/ML integration.

Data Serialization (Jackson): Automatically converts Java objects to JSON and vice versa, enabling seamless communication with frontend clients.

Code Flow
The REST Controller exposes an endpoint /api/recommendations which accepts a user ID parameter.

Upon receiving a GET request, it creates a User object (with user details).

It delegates to the Service Layer, which runs recommendation logic and returns a list of recommended Product objects.

Lombok-annotated model classes simplify data structure definition, reducing code clutter.

Spring Boot uses Jackson to serialize the list of products into JSON and sends it back in the HTTP response.

The frontend receives the JSON and dynamically renders the recommendations on the page.

Architectural Advantages
Separation of Concerns: Controllers manage HTTP, Services manage logic, Models represent data, reducing coupling.

Extensibility: Easily replace or upgrade recommendation algorithms to integrate AI/ML without touching controller or frontend.

Maintainability: Clean, concise Java code facilitated by Lombok and well-defined layers.

Scalability: Carve out database connections, caching layers, or external service calls in service implementations.

How Frontend and Backend Interact
Frontend JavaScript fetches recommendation data asynchronously from the backend using RESTful HTTP calls.

Backend responds with structured JSON representing recommended products.

Frontend dynamically updates UI without reload, improving user experience and responsiveness.

This loosely coupled architecture allows frontends to be independently updated or replaced, as long as JSON API contract remains consistent.

Summary
Your system combines a modern lightweight frontend written with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for immediate user interaction with a clean, scalable, and modular Spring Boot backend powered by Lombok for automation of Java class boilerplate code. This design pattern is ideal for rapid prototyping as well as evolutionary architecture allowing future AI recommendations, persistence, security, and scalability features.

The frontend crafts a visually engaging user experience using CSS gradients and animations, while the backend supplies the essential recommendation data via REST APIs, following best practices of Java web development.

This architecture is flexible, maintainable, and ready for further feature development, including database integration, ML model inference, user personalization, and production deployment.
